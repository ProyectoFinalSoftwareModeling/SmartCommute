## 🚀 Key Features

1. **🔍 Route Inquiry**  
   Users can input the route name or code to retrieve information about the route, including schedules and stops. The query is automatically saved in the user's history.

2. **🅿️ Station Inquiry**  
   Users can search for stations and see the buses that pass through them. This information is also saved in the user's history for future reference.

3. **💳 Card Recharge**  
   The application allows users to recharge their transportation card. If it's the first time, the user will be prompted to input their card details; otherwise, the app will proceed directly to the recharge menu.
